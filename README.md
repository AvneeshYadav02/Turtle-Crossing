# Turtle Crossing Game 🐢🚗 (Python Turtle Edition)

A fun arcade-style game where you control a turtle trying to cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. Built using Python's `turtle` graphics module, this project features player input, collision detection, increasing difficulty, and a scoring system.

## 🕹️ Features

- Player movement using keyboard controls  
- Randomized cars moving horizontally across the screen  
- Collision detection with cars  
- Dynamic difficulty (cars move faster as levels progress)  
- Score tracking and "Game Over" display
